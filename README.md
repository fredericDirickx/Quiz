# Little Arithmetics

Web application to exercise your skills on basic arithmetic's like +, -, * and - .
The idea is that you log in and make some basic arithmetic's in the end you always get a report of the results:
How many correct answers, how many wrong answers, in what time you did it. 

# RoadMap
The goal is to make this a application where you can analyse your results over time, and draw conclusions, but also
to get some propositions on what to work on.

On other feature would be that Group accounts can be made where analyses of a group of persons can me done.
This can me useful for schools or research on groups.
for example: what kind of arithmetic's are the most difficult for which age group. 
Or what kind of colors in the background are influencing the speed of reading the exercises.
